Overall, nice solutions! I like that you kept various versions of the solutions.

Some suggestions for you:
- If you ever get confused while writing single-line functions, you can add a curly brace so that you can write some console.logs or intermediate operations to give yourself visibility on what the code is doing. You can try this for `filter/core.js#onlyOneWord()`
- Generally, reducing overhead can help you to think about problems more clearly. There are many ways you can reduce overhead:
	- remove visual clutter. this can mean removing console.logs / comments / or even the comments in the assignment (i see that you've already done this! good on you)
	- auto-indent your code so that your brain does not need to do mental calculations subconsciously
	- set up your laptop so that you reduce tab-switching. For example you can put your code in the left half of your screen, and whatever else you need on the right half.
	- close browser tabs / unnecessary applications
